## How to run project ?

Because I dont know how you input testcase then please follow below steps to run your testcases. Please run project and input testcase manually

1.	Clone project from: https://github.com/saothienhat/TikiTest
2.	Atfer clone project, please use Eclipse (something like this) run the main class (TikiMainApp)
I use Scanner to get input from User, so after run project, please copy & parse testcase into Console area then ENTER to get the Output.
